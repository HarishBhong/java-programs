Lower Bound in an array:

[2,22,36,48,110]
if asked Lower Bound of 25 -> means find number which is just greater than OR equal to 25 (consider 25 if present)
                           -> here 36 is first number just greater than 25
                           -> hence lower bound of 25 here is 36 in this array

Upper Bound in an array:

if asked Upper bound of 56 -> means first element  STRICTLY greater than 56 (not considering 56 if present)
                           -> here 110 > 56
                           -> Hence Upper bound of 56 is 110 here


Lower & Upper Bound of 36?
--> Lower bound = 36 ( >=36)
--> Upper bound = 48 ( >36)
